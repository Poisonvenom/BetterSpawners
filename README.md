THE SPAWNER DELAY EXPLOIT HAS BEEN PATCHED ON 2B2T. THIS REPO WILL NO LONGER BE MAINTAINED.

BetterSpawners is an Meteor client addon that bypasses spawner detection exploits by making the spawner appear natural.
This mod includes three modules: ActivatedSpawnerDetector, CaveDisturbanceDetector, and SpawnerMask.
The ActivatedSpawnerDetector and CaveDisturbanceDetector modules are included for convenience as the three modules are often used together. ActivatedSpawnerDetector and CaveDisturbanceDetector were created by Etianl and I claim no credit. Special thanks to Nigerianprince and NewHag.

SpawnerMask Usage/Tutorial:
1. Locate the spawner you wish to mask.
2. Make all desired edits to the spawner including hiding any items. It is recommended to make the area look natural. Be aware of cave air around you.
3. Move outside the edge of the spawner dectection radius to the south. This is roughly 17 blocks away from the spawner.
4. Turn on the SpawnerMask module. A blue and green ESP "mat" will appear on the ground (along with a 2x1 rectangle "faceshield" if that is turned on). 
5. Move your player to stand on the green area of the "mat". Try to avoid walking between the mat and the spawner. The green area is just outside the range of the spawner while the blue is within range.
6. A rotation lock will automatically face your player in the right direction, but if that is turned off, face the spawner. The spawner delay should start to be displayed in chat.
7. Hold shift and slowly walk toward the blue area of the mat until you are standing directly on the border between the green and the blue or close enough that the spawner delay starts ticking down.
8. once you are close enough that the delay is counting down, take your hands off the keyboard and let the mod do the rest. The player will automatically move out of range when the delay hits 20.
9. The spawner has now been concealed and feel free to turn the mod off. Be careful not to walk back into range.
10. It is recommended to unload the chunks and relog and then use ActivatedSpawnerDetector to check the spawner to see if it is concealed. Due to server ping it is possible for the spawner to appear concealed when it is not. This is normal, it just may take a couple tries.

 Troubleshooting tips: (spawner not masking)
 1. It may take a couple attempts to mask the spawner, keep trying if it does not work the first time (see step 10).
 2. Absolutely make sure not to move your client while the module is counting down the spawner.
 3. You want your client to be as far away from the spawner as possible while still in the 16 block range. The means the absolute INSTANT the delay shown on the screen starts CHANGING do not move forward any further. If you are too far forward the module will overshoot and it won't work.
 4. Sometimes the spawner will unmask when the client relogs nearby. If this happens move further away or unload the chunks completely and the spawner should stay masked.
 5. The spawner delay can roll over and read all 0's. This is normal and if it happens, stay in range of the spawner until it rolls back into the hundreds and then mask the spawner normally.
