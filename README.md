SpawnerMask is an Meteor client addon that bypasses spawner detection exploits by making the spawner appear natural.
This mod includes two modules: ActivatedSpawnerDetector and MaskSpawner.
The ActivatedSpawnerDetector module is included for convenience as the two modules are often paired together. ActivatedSpawnerDetector was created by Etianl and I claim no credit.
