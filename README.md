BetterSpawners is an Meteor client addon that bypasses spawner detection exploits by making the spawner appear natural.
This mod includes two modules: ActivatedSpawnerDetector and SpawnerMask.
The ActivatedSpawnerDetector module is included for convenience as the two modules are often paired together. ActivatedSpawnerDetector was created by Etianl and I claim no credit. Special thanks to Nigerianprince and NewHag.

SpawnerMask Usage/Tutorial:
1. Locate the spawner you wish to mask.
2. Make all desired edits to the spawner including hiding any desired items.
3. Move outside the edge of the spawner dectection radius. This is roughly 17 blocks away from the spawner. You can use the ActivatedSpawnerDectector as a guide as it draws a 16x16x16 box around the spawner.
4. Position your client: move your client in line with the spawner, facing the spawner. It is recommended that your head position is on the same y level as the spawner (your feet would be standing 1 y level below the spawner). Keep at least 16 blocks distance away from the spawner.
5. Toggle the MaskSpawner module on. The module will automatically detect the closest spawner (keep this in mind if you are near multiple spawners) and send feedback to the chat.
6. Hold shift and slowly move towards the spawner. Slowly. Once you are under 16 blocks, the spawner delay will start displaying on the screen. Keep inching forward until the delay starts actively ticking down, then STOP moving.
7. Take your hands off the keyboard and let the module do the rest. It is extremely important not to move while the delay continues to tick down.
8. Once the delay hits 20 the module will complete and you are free to move again. Turn off the module and be careful not to walk back into range again.
9. You can use the ActivatedSpawnerDetector to confirm if the spawner was properly masked.

 Troubleshooting tips: (spawner not masking)
 1. It may take a couple attempts to mask the spawner, keep trying if it does not work the first time.
 2. Absolutely make sure not to move your client while the module is counting down the spawner.
 3. You want your client to be as far away from the spawner as possible while still in the 16 block range. The means the absolute INSTANT the delay shown on the screen starts CHANGING do not move forward any further. If you are too far forward the module will over shoot and won't work.

 4. Sometimes the spawner will unmask when the client relogs nearby. If this happens move further away or unload the chunks completely and the spawner should stay masked.
 5. The spawner delay can roll over and read all 0's. This is normal and if it happens, stay in range of the spawner until it rolls back to the 200's and then mask the spawner normally.
